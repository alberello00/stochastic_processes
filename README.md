# Stochastic processes notes

Welcome to my repository of notes for the Stochastic Process course. In this repository, you will find my personal notes from the course, which I am sharing for free with anyone who is interested in learning more about this topic.

Please note that these notes are not official, and they may contain errors or omissions. I have attended every lecture and put in many hours of work outside of class to create these notes, but I am not a professional educator or textbook author. That said, I hope that you will find them helpful as a study aid, a supplement to your own notes, or simply as a way to deepen your understanding of stochastic processes.

Because these notes are my personal work and not a commercial product, I will not be uploading them on a regular schedule. I plan to upload them as often as I can, but please be patient if there are long gaps between updates. I take the time to review and re-elaborate the notes to ensure their quality, and that can be a time-consuming process.

If you do find these notes helpful, and would like to support me in creating more educational materials like this, I would greatly appreciate any donation you may be willing to offer. You can send a contribution via PayPal to trashajalberto@gmail.com.

Thank you for your interest in my notes, and I hope that you find them useful in your studies.
